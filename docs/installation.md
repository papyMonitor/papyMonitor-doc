# Installation and usage

## Arduino

The **papyMonitor** folder is a library that you **must** put on your sketchbook location. To see where your sketchbook location is, open the Arduino IDE then select Files->Preferences: A popup windows will show the "Settings" tab, the location is under the "Sketchbook location".
Open this location on your disk and you'll find a folder "libraries". Copy the folder "papyMonitor" inside the folder "libraries". That's it!

### Usage/Documentation

In summary, for each sketch you make (.ino file) you must write a matching .lua file for the papyMonitor-gui to understand what is coming from the serial port. See the "The Target files" documentation and see the examples in the folder examples of the papyMonitor-Arduino repository
